*Day 22 of 100:* Flashcard App Capstone Project

## Project Specs

Using **[Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)** Screen capabilities, program the classic arcade game Pong where two users can play against one another.

This application is written with Python 3.11.

### Main Features
This game application features a randomly moving ball and two paddles: one on the left and one on the right. The object of the game is to bounce the ball off of your paddle so that your oppenent misses, socring you a point. 

The score is tracked for each player at the top of the screen.

## Usage & Requirements

This project uses three classes:
- Ball
- Paddle
- Score

### Workflow
The right hand player controls the movement of the paddle up and down by pressing on the `arrow-up` and `arrow-down` keys.

The left hand player controls the movement of their paddle up and down by pressing on the `w` key for up, and the `s` key for down.

Once a player correctly move their paddle to bounce the ball, the ball does two things: 
- Changes direction toward their opponent
- Speeds up

If your opponent misses the ball, you get a point.

# Getting Started

All of the commands below should be typed into the Python terminal of your IDE (I use PyCharm for my Python Development).

First, clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git clone git@github.com:shelbyblanton/pong-game.git
    
Then open the project in PyCharm.

**Setup is complete!** 

Click Run in PyCharm to see the app in action.
